It allows adding tracing to the application, creating dashboards to view key metrics like RPS, error rates, and costs, and quickly assessing the performance of the application using off-the-shelf evaluators. Additionally, LangSmith provides tools for prompt engineering to help developers find the perfect prompt for their application, iterate on models and prompts in the Playground, and manage prompts programmatically in their application.'}"
